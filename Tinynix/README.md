# Tinynix

## Description
This theme is comprised of five Zooper Widgets named "Boxes", "Home", "Music", "Screenfetch", and "Weather". "Boxes" is comprised of the groups of rectangles in the back *and* the battery widget. The other widgets, "Home", "Music", "Screenfetch", and "Weather" are to be layered over "Boxes"; this can be done within Nova Launcher, for example.

The font used is GohuFont. Icons are from ![Glyphs by Tokems](http://forum.xda-developers.com/android/themes/icons-pack-glyphs-tokems-t3019186).
